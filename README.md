# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave a company using Machine Learning.

## Problem
Employee attrition leads to increased costs, project delays, and loss of skilled talent.  
The goal is to help HR teams identify employees at risk of leaving based on work-related factors.

## Approach
- Baseline Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization
- Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization
- Performance comparison using standard classification metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Result
L2 Regularized Logistic Regression performed best and is recommended for employee attrition prediction.
